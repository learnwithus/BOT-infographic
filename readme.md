# BOT Infographic   
This repo contains the code for the infographic used in BOT.

## Development
The infographic uses HTML, jQuery from a CDN, and sass compiled by gulp.

To compile sass:
1. run `npm i` to install gulp
2. run `gulp` to start the default gulp function. This will start a `browser-sync` server and hot-reload any changes to `index.html`, as well as any files in the `scss` and `js` directories.
